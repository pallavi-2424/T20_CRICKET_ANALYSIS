### Objective:
The main objective of this project is to analyze data from the T20 Cricket world cup 2022 and assemble the best 11 players team that can represent a faction in an intergalactic cricket match against a team of AI-powered robots.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Data Collection using Bright Data Web Scraping:**
   - Utilize Bright Data web scraping to collect comprehensive data from the espncricinfo website related to the Cricket T20 World Cup (2022).

2. **Data Transformation and Cleaning using Pandas:**
   - Process the scraped data and transform it into a usable format for analysis using Python and the Pandas library.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and structuring it into a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into player statistics, team performances, and other relevant aspects of the Galactic T20 Cricket Tournament.

4. **Team Selection Algorithm:**
   - Develop an algorithm that takes into account player performance metrics, team balance, and other relevant factors to select the best 11 players for the faction's team to compete against the AI-powered robots.

5. **Assembling the Best 11 Players Team:**
   - Implement the team selection algorithm to assemble the final best 11 players team for the match against the AI-powered robots.

6. **Power BI Dashboard Creation:**
   - Utilize Power BI to visualize and present the insights derived from the data analysis.
   - Create interactive dashboards to showcase the selected team, player statistics, and other key information.

7. **Documentation and Report:**
   - Prepare comprehensive documentation outlining the project methodology, data sources, data preprocessing steps, analytical approach, and dashboard creation.
   - Present the insights and findings in a well-organized report format.

### Expected Deliverables:

1. **Web Scraping Script:**
   - Utilize Bright Data web scraping to collect comprehensive data from the espncricinfo website related to the Cricket T20 World Cup (2022).

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation Script:**
   - Python script using Pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and structuring.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis Report:**
   - Detailed report showcasing the insights gained from exploratory data analysis.

4. **Team Selection Algorithm Code:**
   - Python script for the algorithm used to select the best 11 players team.

5. **Power BI Dashboard Files:**
   - Power BI files (.pbix) containing interactive dashboards showcasing the analysis and selected team.

6. **Project Documentation and Report:**
   - Comprehensive documentation summarizing the entire project, methodology, and outcomes.

### Potential Learning Outcomes:

- Understanding of web scraping techniques and data collection from online sources.
- Proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation using Python and Pandas.
- Experience in exploratory data analysis to derive meaningful insights from a dataset.
- Algorithm development and application for team selection based on specific criteria.
- Skills in creating interactive dashboards using Power BI for effective data visualization and storytelling.
